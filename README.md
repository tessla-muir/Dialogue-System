# Dialogue System in Unity

## Overview
I developed a robust dialogue system in Unity, designed to have interactive conversations between players and NPCs. Built with a focus on flexibility and ease of use, the system supports complex branching dialogues and integrates seamlessly with other game systems.
   
## Key Features
- Implemented a flexible dialogue node system supporting multiple conversation routes.
- Designed PlayerConversant and AIConversant to manage dialogue flow and interaction.
- Integrated conditional logic for dialogue node visibility based on game state.
- Developed an intuitive editor tool for non-technical users to create and manage dialogue nodes.
- UI/UX design ensuring responsiveness across all desktop resolutions and supporting text and choice-based dialogue formats.

## Editor Tool
The editor tool allows users to visually create, edit, and delete dialogue nodes. It features bezier curves for node relationships, real-time node color indication for player and AI speech, and seamless integration with Unity's inspector for configuring dialogue actions.

## UI Design and Implementation
The UI is designed to scale dynamically to different screen sizes and resolutions. It includes layouts for text-based and choice-based dialogues, utilizing Unity events to update UI elements in real time as conversations progress.

## Application in Games
This dialogue system has been successfully integrated into three different games, showcasing its versatility and adaptability:
1. [**The Long Hallway**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jpz-vqOugcW31bOnY-Pb7TLIYIiEFskjXCyfdmfOHVA/edit?usp=sharing) - Utilized for branching storylines and character-driven dialogues, enhancing player immersion and storytelling.
2. [**Fantasy Scheme**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8ir2EVsTrkE0diwToQDJZSQM9B30uWACVE5fl8bX3o/edit?usp=sharing) - Integrated and expanded upon for the main mechanic of RPG text-battle (similar to Pokemon).
3. [**One Man's Trash**](https://www.monrivergames.com/onemanstrash) - Implemented to enhance NPC interactions and quest dialogues, providing players with meaningful choices and narrative depth.

## Technical Details
The dialogue system utilizes Unity's GameObject and ScriptableObject architecture for node management. Dialogue nodes are dynamically linked based on player choices, with support for complex branching and conditional execution based on game variables.

## Conclusion
This project highlights my ability in Unity development, UI/UX design, and system architecture. It demonstrates the ability to create intuitive tools for non-programmers while delivering robust functionality for game dialogue management.
